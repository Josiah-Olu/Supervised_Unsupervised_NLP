README: Machine Learning and Data Mining Report



This report contains the analysis and implementation of three machine learning tasks:



1. Task 1: Predicting Obesity Levels

   - Used Decision Tree, KNN, and Azure ML models.

   - Explored and preprocessed data for accurate predictions.



2. Task 2: Customer Segmentation

   - Applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for segmentation.

   - Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and silhouette scores for evaluation.



3. Task 3: Sentiment Analysis on Steam Reviews

   - Text classification using Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB).

   - Sentiment analysis performed using VADER.



The report demonstrates the use of Python (Scikit-learn, NLTK, etc.) and Azure ML for model development, evaluation, and insights. Refer to the full report for detailed implementation and results.
